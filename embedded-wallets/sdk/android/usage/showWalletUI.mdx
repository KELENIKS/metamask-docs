The `showWalletUI` method launches a WebView which allows you to use the templated wallet UI services. The method automatically uses the chain configuration from your project settings and no longer requires manual `ChainConfig` parameter. Wallet Services is currently only available for EVM chains.

:::note

Access to Wallet Services is gated. You can use this feature in `sapphire_devnet` for free. The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this feature in a production environment is the **Scale Plan**.

:::warning

The chain configuration is now automatically retrieved from your project settings in the Web3Auth Dashboard. Make sure your project has the appropriate chains configured in the dashboard.
